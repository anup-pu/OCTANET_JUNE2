This project is an animated to-do list built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to offer a seamless task management experience. Users can add, edit, delete, and filter tasks, with each task stored locally using the browser's local storage to ensure persistence across sessions. The to-do list features smooth animations for task transitions, enhancing user interaction. The JavaScript code handles key functionalities such as displaying tasks based on their status, updating task completion, and managing task edits and deletions. Tasks can be filtered to show all, completed, or pending items, and users can clear all tasks with a single click. The interface is designed to be intuitive, with added features like task images and an animated slide-in effect for new tasks, making the list both functional and visually appealing.
